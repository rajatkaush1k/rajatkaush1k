<br>
<strong>I am Rajat Kaushik, a Frontend Engineer with a passion for transforming data into graphical user interfaces & engaging experiences for the next generation of web applications.</strong><br/><br/>
My tech stack of preference is Next.js, TypeScript, React, Tailwind & Zustand/React-Query, all of which I've worked with for years now but I also don't mind getting my hands dirty & learning the latest tech in the ever-evolving world of Frontend development.
<br/><br/>

Outside the coding realm, I enjoy travelling, learning new things, working out, cooking, listening to music & podcasts, playing with my dog and gaming. I'm also fond of doing nothing at all sometimes (important!)

I've had a keen interest in building things since I was a kid; from breaking & modifying RC cars, running my own multiplayer game servers (mostly in SA:MP), building websites on the likes of Wix and Yola as a 12yo, to now developing large-scale Frontend applications end-to-end on my own, I've always had passion for translating complex problems into engaging experiences. I'm currently the Frontend Lead at CosmicJS and have previously worked at Unacademy (Graphy) where I lead the Frontend of some projects at Graphy.

This is my work GitHub, you can find my personal projects (albeit old) on my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.github.com/itsrajat">

<br>
<strong>I am Rajat Kaushik, a Frontend Engineer with a passion for UX, product engineering & problem-solving.</strong><br/>
I enjoy getting my hands dirty with new tech, learning new things but my tech stack of preference is Next.js, TypeScript, React, Tailwind & Zustand/React-Query, which of which I've worked with for years now.
<br/><br/>

Outside the coding realm, I enjoy travelling, learning new things, working out, cooking, listening to music & podcasts, playing with my dog and gaming.

I've had a keen interest in building things since I was a kid; from breaking & modifying RC cars, running my own multiplayer game servers (mostly in SA:MP), building websites on the likes of Wix and Yola as a 12yo, to now developing large-scale Frontend applications end-to-end on my own, I've always had passion for translating complex problems into engaging experiences. I'm currently the Frontend Lead at CosmicJS and have previously worked at Unacademy (Graphy) where I lead the Frontend of some projects at Graphy.
